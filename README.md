# CSC-340-Team-Project
The team project final for my Ethics and Software Design class

Project Members: Nicholas Cordial, Larry Frost, Lucas Bevins

The project was intended to demonstrate an understanding of software engineering. Included is a design specification report and the code for the program that we were instructed to create for the final.
The program is that of a mock online ordering software.
